# AIQ Project - Workstream Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the consolidated work streams in the AIQ project. Each work stream focuses on a specific area of improvement and has been carefully designed to address current code quality issues and enhance the application's maintainability, reliability, and performance.

## Work Stream Labels

| Work Stream | Description | Priority |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| workstream-data-access | Standardize database access patterns | Highest |
| workstream-mock-replacement | Replace mock data with real Supabase DB integration | High |
| workstream-repository-pattern | Implement repository pattern across modules | High |
| workstream-auth | Authentication and permission system improvements | Medium |
| workstream-navigation | Consolidate navigation and role-based access | Medium | 
| workstream-type-centralization | Centralize TypeScript types and improve type safety | Medium |
| workstream-ui | UI component improvements and standardization | Low |

## Implementation Priority and Dependencies

The work streams have been prioritized based on their impact and dependencies:

1. **workstream-data-access** (Highest Priority)
   - Critical foundation for all other improvements
   - Fixes database access inconsistency issues
   - Enables reliable data fetching across the application
   - Implementation script: `scripts/implement-data-access-pattern.js`

2. **workstream-mock-replacement**
   - Builds on the data access improvements
   - Ensures all components use real data consistently
   - Makes testing more reliable with actual data sources
   - Implementation script: `scripts/implement-mock-replacement.js`

3. **workstream-repository-pattern**
   - Structured approach to data access after basic patterns are established
   - Introduces cleaner architecture for data operations
   - Current focus of many sprint tasks (#121-129)
   - Implementation script: `scripts/implement-repository-pattern.js`

4. **workstream-auth**
   - Fixes core permission and authentication issues
   - Needed for proper role-based access
   - Prerequisite for navigation improvements

5. **workstream-navigation**
   - Builds on authentication and permission improvements
   - Already organized as a sequence of tasks (#138-145)
   - Provides consistent UI for navigating the application

6. **workstream-type-centralization**
   - Can be implemented in parallel with other streams
   - Improves code reliability and maintenance
   - Recently added as a structured set of tasks (#146-148)

7. **workstream-ui** (Can be done incrementally)
   - Standardizing UI components
   - Implementing consistent design patterns
   - Improving accessibility and user experience

## Work Stream Details

### workstream-data-access

The `workstream-data-access` initiative standardizes database access patterns across the codebase by introducing a function-based approach for all database operations.

**Key Components:**
- `safeTableAccess` utility to safely access schema-prefixed tables
- Module-specific database access functions (e.g., `assessmentModule`, `itemModule`)
- `DatabaseStatus` component for monitoring database connectivity
- Comprehensive error handling and response formatting

**Implementation Script:**
- `scripts/implement-data-access-pattern.js`
- The script analyzes the codebase for direct schema-prefixed table access
- Generates module-specific database access functions
- Creates the `DatabaseStatus` component
- Produces a detailed report of what needs to be refactored

**Related Issues:**
- Issues #58, #62, and other database-related tasks

### workstream-mock-replacement

The `workstream-mock-replacement` initiative replaces all mock data with real Supabase database integration.

**Key Components:**
- Identification of mock data usage throughout the codebase
- Strategy for replacing mock data with real database access
- Test data utilities for consistent testing
- Implementation of loading states in UI components

**Implementation Script:**
- `scripts/implement-mock-replacement.js`
- The script analyzes the codebase for mock data usage
- Categorizes mock data by module
- Generates a replacement plan for each module
- Creates test data utilities for testing

**Dependencies:**
- Depends on `workstream-data-access` for the standardized database access patterns

### workstream-repository-pattern

The `workstream-repository-pattern` initiative implements the repository pattern across all modules to provide a clean separation between data access logic and business logic.

**Key Components:**
- Repository interfaces defining data access contracts
- Repository implementations providing data access logic
- Repository factories for consistent instance access
- Comprehensive documentation and migration guides

**Implementation Script:**
- `scripts/implement-repository-pattern.js`
- The script analyzes the codebase for direct database access
- Generates repository structures for each module
- Creates usage examples for each repository
- Produces comprehensive documentation

**Related Issues:**
- Issues #121-129 focusing on repository pattern implementation

**Dependencies:**
- Builds on both `workstream-data-access` and `workstream-mock-replacement`

### workstream-auth

The `workstream-auth` initiative improves the authentication and permission system.

**Key Components:**
- Standardization of authentication flows
- Implementation of robust permission checks
- Enhancement of user management
- Consolidation of authentication-related components

**Related Issues:**
- Various authentication-related issues

**Dependencies:**
- Builds on the standardized database access from previous streams

### workstream-navigation

The `workstream-navigation` initiative consolidates navigation and implements role-based access controls.

**Key Components:**
- Unified navigation system
- Role-based access controls
- Consistent navigation components
- Improved routing structure

**Related Issues:**
- Issues #138-145 focusing on navigation improvements

**Dependencies:**
- Depends on `workstream-auth` for role-based access controls

### workstream-type-centralization

The `workstream-type-centralization` initiative centralizes TypeScript types and improves type safety.

**Key Components:**
- Centralized type definitions in `src/core/types/`
- Consistent type imports
- Improved type safety
- Reduction of type duplication

**Related Issues:**
- Issues #146-148 focusing on type centralization

### workstream-ui

The `workstream-ui` initiative standardizes UI components and implements consistent design patterns.

**Key Components:**
- Standardized UI components
- Consistent design patterns
- Improved accessibility
- Enhanced user experience

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to addressing the key improvement areas in the AIQ project. By following this plan, we will systematically enhance the codebase's quality, maintainability, and reliability while minimizing the risk of disruption to ongoing development efforts.

The scripts provided in the `scripts/` directory automate much of the initial analysis and setup for each work stream, but careful manual review and adjustment will still be required to ensure that the implementations align with the project's specific requirements and constraints.
