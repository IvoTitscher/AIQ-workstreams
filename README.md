# AIQ Project - Work Streams Implementation

This repository contains implementation scripts and documentation for the consolidated work streams in the AIQ project. These work streams are designed to improve code quality, maintainability, and reliability across the application.

## Work Streams Overview

| Work Stream | Description | Priority | Implementation Script |
|-------------|-------------|----------|------------------------|
| workstream-data-access | Standardize database access patterns | Highest | `implement-data-access-pattern.js` |
| workstream-mock-replacement | Replace mock data with real Supabase DB integration | High | `implement-mock-replacement.js` |
| workstream-repository-pattern | Implement repository pattern across modules | High | `implement-repository-pattern.js` |
| workstream-auth | Authentication and permission system improvements | Medium | - |
| workstream-navigation | Consolidate navigation and role-based access | Medium | - |
| workstream-type-centralization | Centralize TypeScript types and improve type safety | Medium | - |
| workstream-ui | UI component improvements and standardization | Low | - |

## Using the Implementation Scripts

The scripts are designed to analyze the codebase, generate template code, and provide implementation guidance for each work stream.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+ installed
- Access to the AIQ codebase
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated (for the label script only)

### Running the Scripts

1. Copy the script files to the `scripts/` directory in your AIQ project:
   ```
   cp scripts/* /path/to/your/aiq-project/scripts/
   ```

2. Make the scripts executable:
   ```
   chmod +x /path/to/your/aiq-project/scripts/*.js
   ```

3. Run the scripts in the recommended order:
   ```
   cd /path/to/your/aiq-project
   
   # First, standardize database access patterns
   node scripts/implement-data-access-pattern.js
   
   # Then, replace mock data with real database integration
   node scripts/implement-mock-replacement.js
   
   # Finally, implement the repository pattern
   node scripts/implement-repository-pattern.js
   
   # Update GitHub labels (requires GitHub CLI)
   node scripts/update-workstream-labels.js
   ```

4. Each script will generate implementation code and detailed reports in the project root directory:
   - `workstream-data-access-report.md`
   - `workstream-mock-replacement-report.md`
   - `workstream-repository-pattern-report.md`

5. Review the generated reports and code, then proceed with implementing the recommended changes.

## Implementation Order

Follow this implementation order to minimize risks and dependencies:

1. **workstream-data-access**: Provides the foundation for all other improvements
2. **workstream-mock-replacement**: Builds on the standardized database access
3. **workstream-repository-pattern**: Introduces cleaner architecture for data operations
4. **workstream-auth**: Improves authentication and permission systems
5. **workstream-navigation**: Consolidates navigation with role-based access
6. **workstream-type-centralization**: Can be implemented in parallel with other streams
7. **workstream-ui**: Can be implemented incrementally

## Documentation

- [Workstream Implementation Plan](workstream-implementation-plan.md): Comprehensive implementation plan for all work streams
- Documentation generated by the scripts:
  - Repository Pattern Guide: `docs/repository-pattern-guide.md`
  - Repository Migration Guide: `docs/repository-pattern-migration.md`

## Implementation Timeline

The complete implementation is estimated to take approximately 8 weeks:

1. **Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**: data-access, beginning of mock-replacement
2. **Phase 2: Advanced Data Access (Weeks 3-4)**: Finish mock-replacement, start repository-pattern
3. **Phase 3: Authentication and Navigation (Weeks 5-6)**: Finish repository-pattern, auth, start navigation
4. **Phase 4: Type Safety and UI (Weeks 7-8)**: Finish navigation, type-centralization, start UI

## Benefits

Implementing these work streams will result in:

- More consistent and reliable database access
- Elimination of mock data for better testing and production reliability
- Clear separation of data access and business logic
- Improved testability and maintainability
- Enhanced type safety
- Consistent UI components and patterns
- Better navigation and role-based access control
